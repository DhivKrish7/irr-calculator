# IRR Calculator (Bisection Method)

This project calculates the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for any series of user defined cashflows using the Bisection method, a numerical root finding technique.

The IRR is the discount rate that makes the Net Present Value (NPV) of a projectâ€™s cashflows equals to zero. So mathematically we equalize the NPV calculation formula to 0, and then find IRR. Since there's no direct algebric calculation method for IRR, we can use the Bisection method to find it.
