# irr-calculator
This project calculates the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for any series of user defined cashflows using the Bisection method, a numerical root finding technique. 

The IRR is the discount rate that makes the Net Present Value (NPV) of all cash flows equal to zero. So mathematically to find IRR we equalize the NPV formula to zero, then we find solution for IRR. Since thereâ€™s no direct algebric solution for IRR, we use the Bisection method to find it.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the irr_calculator.py file
3. Type your series of cashflows and press 'Enter'
4. The file give you the calculated IRR
